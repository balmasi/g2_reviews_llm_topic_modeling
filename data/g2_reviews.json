Dashboarding translates cleanly to the mobile application, and on-screen views are professional and effective for communicating data to higher level users.\n\nI have been involved with Hyperion and TM1 implementations in past roles, and Anaplan is by far the easiest and fastest to implement. Changes on-the-go are also very efficient to roll out, which is not the case with more complicated and less-sophisticated platforms. For organizations that experience dynamic lines of business, Anaplan is an ideal solution for quickly developing what-if scenario analysis to reduce uncertainty and promote smarter forecasting.",
            "Managing large amounts of data presents a challenge at times. Due to Anaplan's configuration as a planning tool, there is a trade-off between calculation speed and data storage capabilities. Many times, our users would like to see highly specific, transaction level details within Anaplan, but due to the size of our organization, this is generally an impossible task to accomplish without exceeding the maximum allowed workspace size parameters.\n\nReporting is also not a strong suit for Anaplan. Most of our users are used to more flexible ad-hoc reporting similar to what is offered in Excel from Hyperion or TM1, so creating reports to match the capabilities of other tools often presents challenges. However, as with all things in Anaplan, the more time you spend in the system as a developer, the more you are able to find solutions for previously unsolvable problems.",

Any company needs to invest in a full-time staff to support the system, which will increase user adoption as well as grow the use case potential within the organization. I have yet to run into a situation that cannot be solved with Anaplan, but it took time, creativity and an architectural focus to design solutions that had not yet been discovered by other developers."

In short, it is the answer to making big data useful. No one sifts through thousands or millions of transactions to see patterns and trends. Anaplan gives you the tool set do it. Additionally, Anaplan is build-to-suit; the answer to 'Can Anaplan do it?' is almost always 'yes'; it can consume and enhance your current data structures as well as provide the foundation for bona fide process transformation.",
            "While the nature of the tool promotes collaboration in the planning process through its role functionality, the day-to-day collaboration is not mature yet. There is room to grow in workflow and collaboration-specific functionality (e.g. comments in-platform).",
            "As an implementation partner, I help companies solve a variety of problems with Anaplan. I primarily focus on sales performance management (SPM), so I will comment from that perspective. The most pervasive business problems that are solved by Anaplan are developing and managing territories and setting and adjusting quotas for the sales force. Most organizations lack any type of enterprise-level solution that does this, and the most frequent 'system' that is replaced is Excel. Anaplan provides a single source of truth for territories and targets; it allows for collaboration around that single data set and holistic data analytics that provide insights from an individual sales rep to mid-level managers to executives who oversee regions, business units, and entire organizations. The most potent advantage that is realized is the ability to view high-level KPIs, but to then drill into the details at a low level to understand what is driving them.",

            "Anaplan is not an out of the box solution that forces companies to fit their business process into a predefined mold, it allows businesses to build up models and planning processes that fit their needs and can continue to evolve as their business grows and changes. It is difficult to imagine a modeling scenario you can't build in Anaplan. The tool allows for a lot of flexibility in the type of planning a customer wants to do, and can truly be owned/managed by end users instead of by IT. This allows for much quicker turnaround on adjustments to a model.",
            "Since Anaplan is not a pre-built solution, it does require more up-front investment in time and resources to get set up. It requires participation from multiple groups across the organization to put together a well-thought out model and more importantly to maintain and update the model on a regular cadence to keep up with a growing company. This can allow for things that shouldn't exist in Anaplan to be put into Anaplan (such as data storage).\n\nI also think ANaplan's front end and reporting capabilities could vastly improve the appeal of the platform, this could help reduce a customer's need for separate reporting/dashboarding in another tool like Tableau and further streamline processes by having robust reporting directly in Anaplan.",
            "Anaplan very quickly solves a lot of issues around internal communication and transfer of information because it is cloud based. Instead of having multiple versions of documents, a \"living\" version of business plans sits in Anaplan where anyone from the organization can access to review and make changes. This in itself reduces a lot of the time spent on planning. Through implementing Anaplan solutions at multiple clients, across several industries and use cases,  I have consistently found that having a dedicated model admin that knows how to build and adjust the model on the client side is most effective, it allows the client to view and approach using Anaplan as an App that requires regular updates and releases of updates to end users, rather than a one-time set up.",
            "Have a clear plan for the future state process you would like to have in Anaplan before starting on building Anaplan; this will make the build easier, faster and ultimately result in a better model output. If you try to design a process during the build, it can quickly get messy as things are built/rebuilt or the direction is changed halfway through the build."

        "answers_raw": "Anaplan is very good at handling complex calculations and modeling logic applied to vast amounts of data. So Anaplan can solve problems that clients have where excel just cannot handle the levels of calculations required. I have modeled many things in Anaplan, from supply chains to call centres, to investment funds and also the obvious things like P&L's, Balance Sheet, and cashflow. You build everything from scratch so you can model pretty much anything\nAnother great use of Anaplan is where you want to guide the user to follow a process. You can add in whatever data validations/controls, process gates, signoff/approval stages you need. And provide the user with real-time analysis of how their inputs have impacted their plan and any KPI's connected to it\nThe best attribute that helps Anaplan's long term success with clients is how the models can be adapted to move with the business, so as the business and its environment changes, the model can adapt and stay relevent. Which stops users reverting back to Excel\nThe focus of new features over the past few years has been very much on making the end users experience better. So model builders have been left behind somewhat, mainly from the point of view of writing and interrogating formulas, so there is scope to make our lives easier and modelling even faster. However there is an update expected soon which is promised to make the modelers lives a lot easier, so watch this space\nIntegrated P&L > Balance Sheet > Cashflow\nThis significantly sped up the quarterly forecasting process for my client, and I also built lots of checks for account mappings to identify any holes in the mappings which could cause a variance to the balance sheet or any of the inbuild balance checks. As the model was vast so the model admins had to really stay on top of new accounts or mappings coming in\n\nIFRS Modelling Contract Revenue\nAnaplan was able to perform the calcs at a much more detailed level than excel, which was already at its limits and provides lots of analysis for the business. Although the primary purpose was for statutory reporting on the clients' contracts over the contract life\n\nPrivate Equity Fund modeling\nLooking backward at investor level to calculate provisions, and looking forward for the rest of the fund's life at a deal level. To determine the expected returns on investment. The main benefit for the client is providing a solid platform to bring together their actuals plus the ability to overlay what-ifs for the outlook and compare multiple scenarios against each other. The inputs being at a level high enough for fund managers to relate to, but the underlying logic is very detailed to the extent of making decisions on when to call from or distribute to investors in a more life like way\n\nSupply vs Demand modelling\nIn a range of industries, including energy, telecoms, and consumer goods. The principle is fairly similar for all of these industries, matching supply and demand, identifying variances. As with previous applictaions the main benefits were related to performing the calculations at a more detailed level than Excel can handle, and providing operations with multiple scenarios to try out mutiple ways to resolve supply or demand issues Anaplan picks up from where"

Excel cannot restrict individual cell access. Anaplan has the flexibility to plan across many dimensions, which excel does not have.\nThe PowerPoint add-in feature is a little obsolete and unnecessary with the launch of the new UX.\nAnaplan helps with different types of planning. I have been involved in Financial Planning and Analysis for four years now. I am assisting clients in moving from Excel sheets to Anaplan planning UX. Anaplan can have scheduled data integrations from external data sources such as Informatica Cloud, SnapLogic, Mulesoft, Dell Boomi, Docusign, Workiva, and Tableau. It has dynamic time scale implementation.\nMaster Data structure \u2013 works on having one data hub with a single source of truth, build once and push multiple times approach.Pushing hierarchical changes across multiple worksheets is tough and error-prone \nEasy for business users to adapt and easy to maintain. Anaplan has checks and balances in place to flag errors and correct inputs."

            "<v ->My name is Ricardo T., I'm a Senior Financial Analyst</v> in the mobile security software industry, and I gave Anaplan a 7 out of 10. Anaplan is a cloud based tool which allows the team to work simultaneously in the same model without having to worry about any version control issues. Once the model is set up, the formulas are very (mouth claps) steady and there's no real need to really worrying about formulas breaking so the model is very steady once it is fully set up and operational. One of my least favorite features about Anaplan is having to learn the MDX coding in order to update the model and formulas. So, this is a coding language that is unique to most financial tools. Oftentimes it requires a consultant, and again it is (mouth claps) unique to financial tools, so, it is an investment in yourself and learning Anaplan. Anaplan is a planning tool which most makes sense for companies that are already a little bit more sure on their growth path. You either have a dedicated or almost dedicated person who can learn the MDX coding and who can maintain and update the model, that's one alternative."

            "The best part about using Anaplan is the ease of connecting models & various use cases into a consolidated format for the end users. For example, a P&L can be the backbone of a reporting model with smaller calculation models that feed the end result. This allows the models to be more granular in nature without affecting the main submission model and reduces performance impacts on the main model.",
            "Some functions are limited (like subset of versions, subsets of users), but there are workarounds that the community has suggested. The roadmap is constantly developing and we are seeing some issues addressed with the releases. One major aspect that is recently being addressed is the key word highlighting when writing formulas. It is still in its infancy and has a bit of ways to go before it can be fully utilized.",
            "Our use cases currently include aggregating a bottoms-up forecast for financial metrics, allocations of sales data for more granular visibility into performance, a bottoms-up calculation to determine COGM by product and region. It ultimately shortens time to understand where the numbers are coming from; perform allocations with minimal interaction; integrates with 3rd party platforms via APIs. We have seen a reduction in errors per forecast and time required in the model.",
            "Spend the time upfront to flesh out your data structures & feeds - it can save you many headaches once you're knee-deep building a model. Keep a close relationship with the ones building integrations and tables in your warehouse if you don't have a resource dedicated to your team. Otherwise, it can be cumbersome to develop the proper connections for your data automation processes."

The amount of time that is saved on the consolidating alone is probably a half day of effort per week.  Other benefits specific to revenue planning is our revenue planning models in Excel were complex, large and very slow.

            "I dislike Adaptive's/Workday's business model because it incentives customer neglect.  During our evaluation process Adaptive seemed to have an excellent product and it was reasonably priced.  During this process we explained to the sales person that we had a very tight implementation goal and he reassured us several times that it would be challenging but we could make it.  The problem is that as soon as the licensing agreement was signed they passed us off to an implementation consultant (Revelwood), and it was up to Revelwood to deliver on all the promises Adaptive made.\r\n\r\nRevelwood confirmed that the timeline was going to be tight but said they could do it.  We agreed to a very minimal feature implementation in order to achieve the go live.  However, Revelwood repeatedly missed deadlines, had extremely poor communication, and did a terrible job of project management.   \r\n\r\nAfer missing a couple deadlines I complained to Adaptive and they raised the issue with Revelwood who responded by changing project managers.  The new project manager seemed like he was going to be great and I was hopeful everything would get back on track.  However, first impressions were misleading and we had all the same issues.  At one point our goal was to go live by Thanksgiving (our original go live was mid-June) and I told them that if there was any reason we would not be able to hit that goal I wanted to be notified as far in advance as possible and not to find out a day or two before we failed to go live.  Instead of giving me advance warning that we would miss the deadline, or even last minute notice, they simply told me nothing.  Thanksgiving came and went and they were completely silent.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it got so late in the year we had to put the project on hold so we could do our annual budgeting process, still in Excel instead of Adaptive as we had expected.  Revelwood's repeated excuse was that our timeline for implementation was too aggressive.  However, by the time we put the project on hold it was past the duration they said was typical for a full implementation and we were doing an extremely minimal implementation.  So their excuse doesn't hold water.\r\n\r\nIt has been over a year since we signed the original subscription agreement and we still do not have a functional system.  Since we have not been using the system a client success manager from Adaptive reached out to us to see what they could do.  Unfortunately, do to competing priorities we will not be able to restart the implementation for several months.  This means we will have paid for 2 years of service and gotten absolutely no value out of it.  As such, I asked Adaptive if they could credit us for our first year of service and put a pause on our next invoice due shortly.  They said they couldn't do that.\r\n\r\nThis brings us back to their horrible business model (which I think is pretty common for large software packages like this).  During the sales process Adaptive is willing to promise the moon because they know they won't have to deliver on any of those promises.  They will pass the customer off to someone else and yet Adaptive still gets 3 years of subscription fees regardless of customer experience.  And Adaptive does not care enough about the long term relationship with the customer to be concerned about whether they are having a good experience.  They just want their 3 years of revenue.  This seems very short sighted on their part.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of good FP&A systems out there and I regret choosing Adaptive.  We are currently considering going with a different FP&A system even though it means we will have a third year of wasted subscription fees.  Finding a true business partner may be worth the expense - that is how disappointing this experience has been.",

Whilst marketed as a whole ecosystem and the Power of One, a lot of dimensions that can be used in Adaptive cannot be sync-ed back into Workday due to the limitation on dimensions/worktags available on Workday Plan Template.\r\n\r\nOn Adaptive alone, performance can be a big issue especially when we run detailed and complex formulas to support our budget/forecasting requirements. On the report side, there are also known instances of lag in the flow down of information to the report side when changes to inputs have been made at the lowest input sheet level (ie. after a change in input at the sheet, some reports do not immediately reflect the changes). This proves extremely frustrating as the real-time visibility and budgeting abilities are lost.\r\n\r\nThe integration support within Adaptive can also be made more comprehensive. An example is the lag of ability within Adaptive to filter only distinct values for creation as dimensions or metadata in Adaptive. Workday side does not support Matrix reports for web services for integration, and on Adaptive side, no distinct vallues can be fitlered out. The double whammy on both WD and AI side results in a lot of manual intervention when we are looking to bring in distinct values.

            "The flexibility offered by this product is amazing, it allows you to build a model that suits your business needs. Regardless of HOW you do business, Adaptive supports this as you create your own structure, custom accounts, and cost drivers, and  then consolidate the data to reports and dashboards,\r\n\r\nImplementing Adaptive for our budgeting was a game changer, it put the data in the hands of the budget owners. As budgets changed throughout the iterative process, we knew that we were always looking at the most up-to-date version by running a single report - no more manual reconciliations / updates. ",
            "Because the software is so flexible, you have to be very careful when creating formulas and building reports that you are capturing all of the information. While it is easy to segment a particular set of data, it is also easy to leave that out if you do not understand the structure and connections within the various moving pieces. Take the time to plan your organization and account structure, and really take the time to understand it, and you will be fine. ",
            "We have gained major efficiencies in our annual budget process - cutting down time spent consolidating budgets or getting the data in to the right format for different stakeholders. This allows our Finance team to spend more time on analysis and strategy than data entry. In addition, with the ability to have different versions, we have moved to a more frequent forecasting schedule, which allows us to keep a better eye on how we are tracking and manage risk.  Fantastic Product And Vendor Support, But Invest The Time",
            "If you can, meet some customers in your industry who use Adaptive already. Now, we are in contact with another organization who went live before we did, and we have helped each other to build tools and reports and address challenges that apply to both companies. It would have been great to learn about some of the challenges up front and how we could have addressed some of the shortcomings of our other software, or with a change to our configuration before implementing. And again, take the time to first review your financial planning and reporting processes and figure out how you can improve them using the new system, rather than trying to fit Adaptive to your \"current state\"."

You can mitigate this somewhat with linking but I'd like to see faster loading between these sheets or easier navigation between sublevels of the same level.  Maybe a side-by-side option where you can see what changes to rollup will occur with changes to a level.",

            "My favorite thing about Adaptive is actually a few things. I love that it can be completely customized for the unique details of your company, i love that it is powerful enough to plan by 5 different segments, and I LOVE that it saves me time. However, its best feature is that it has an incredibly simple user interface that anyone in your organization can learn.",
            "The only drawback I have encountered is that the lowest level of detail is monthly. That may be fine for planning but it isn't great for reporting or dashboards. They do provide daily detail in Discovery enterprise but I would really like them to add it to the regular suite. \r\n\r\nI will add that they have a very responsive product team and they are constantly updating and improving the product.",
            "We began to look at planning and reporting software because we needed a system that could handle extensive cost allocations, multiple budget versions, varied organizational structures and provide us with TIMELY and powerful reporting, drill down and analysis. Adaptive has delivered on all fronts.",
            "My recommendation to others looking at Adaptive is to ask questions, dream big and be prepared to view the budget planning and reporting process differently. Adaptive is a whole new ballgame-don't limit yourself before you even get off the bench.\r\n\r\nI would also strongly recommend that you purchase the complete Adaptive Suite and not just planning. It make a lot of difference to the overall usefulness as they complement each other. "
