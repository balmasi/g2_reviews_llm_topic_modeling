The Amazon S3 connector for example, has proven to be incredibly useful for our business.",

Centralizing information also allows users to view changes from other parts of our organization, which drives more efficient planning cycles and communication among departments.\n\nThe new user experience is also industry-best. Dashboarding translates cleanly to the mobile application, and on-screen views are professional and effective for communicating data to higher level users.\n\nI have been involved with Hyperion and TM1 implementations in past roles, and Anaplan is by far the easiest and fastest to implement. Changes on-the-go are also very efficient to roll out, which is not the case with more complicated and less-sophisticated platforms. For organizations that experience dynamic lines of business, Anaplan is an ideal solution for quickly developing what-if scenario analysis to reduce uncertainty and promote smarter forecasting.",
            "Managing large amounts of data presents a challenge at times. Due to Anaplan's configuration as a planning tool, there is a trade-off between calculation speed and data storage capabilities. Many times, our users would like to see highly specific, transaction level details within Anaplan, but due to the size of our organization, this is generally an impossible task to accomplish without exceeding the maximum allowed workspace size parameters.\n\nReporting is also not a strong suit for Anaplan. Most of our users are used to more flexible ad-hoc reporting similar to what is offered in Excel from Hyperion or TM1, so creating reports to match the capabilities of other tools often presents challenges. However, as with all things in Anaplan, the more time you spend in the system as a developer, the more you are able to find solutions for previously unsolvable problems.",

Any company needs to invest in a full-time staff to support the system, which will increase user adoption as well as grow the use case potential within the organization. I have yet to run into a situation that cannot be solved with Anaplan, but it took time, creativity and an architectural focus to design solutions that had not yet been discovered by other developers."

In short, it is the answer to making big data useful. No one sifts through thousands or millions of transactions to see patterns and trends. Anaplan gives you the tool set do it. Additionally, Anaplan is build-to-suit; the answer to 'Can Anaplan do it?' is almost always 'yes'; it can consume and enhance your current data structures as well as provide the foundation for bona fide process transformation.",
            "While the nature of the tool promotes collaboration in the planning process through its role functionality, the day-to-day collaboration is not mature yet. There is room to grow in workflow and collaboration-specific functionality (e.g. comments in-platform).",
            "As an implementation partner, I help companies solve a variety of problems with Anaplan. I primarily focus on sales performance management (SPM), so I will comment from that perspective. The most pervasive business problems that are solved by Anaplan are developing and managing territories and setting and adjusting quotas for the sales force. Most organizations lack any type of enterprise-level solution that does this, and the most frequent 'system' that is replaced is Excel. Anaplan provides a single source of truth for territories and targets; it allows for collaboration around that single data set and holistic data analytics that provide insights from an individual sales rep to mid-level managers to executives who oversee regions, business units, and entire organizations. The most potent advantage that is realized is the ability to view high-level KPIs, but to then drill into the details at a low level to understand what is driving them.",

            "Anaplan is not an out of the box solution that forces companies to fit their business process into a predefined mold, it allows businesses to build up models and planning processes that fit their needs and can continue to evolve as their business grows and changes. It is difficult to imagine a modeling scenario you can't build in Anaplan. The tool allows for a lot of flexibility in the type of planning a customer wants to do, and can truly be owned/managed by end users instead of by IT. This allows for much quicker turnaround on adjustments to a model.",
            "Since Anaplan is not a pre-built solution, it does require more up-front investment in time and resources to get set up. It requires participation from multiple groups across the organization to put together a well-thought out model and more importantly to maintain and update the model on a regular cadence to keep up with a growing company. This can allow for things that shouldn't exist in Anaplan to be put into Anaplan (such as data storage).\n\nI also think ANaplan's front end and reporting capabilities could vastly improve the appeal of the platform, this could help reduce a customer's need for separate reporting/dashboarding in another tool like Tableau and further streamline processes by having robust reporting directly in Anaplan.",
            "Anaplan very quickly solves a lot of issues around internal communication and transfer of information because it is cloud based. Instead of having multiple versions of documents, a \"living\" version of business plans sits in Anaplan where anyone from the organization can access to review and make changes. This in itself reduces a lot of the time spent on planning. Through implementing Anaplan solutions at multiple clients, across several industries and use cases,  I have consistently found that having a dedicated model admin that knows how to build and adjust the model on the client side is most effective, it allows the client to view and approach using Anaplan as an App that requires regular updates and releases of updates to end users, rather than a one-time set up.",
            "Have a clear plan for the future state process you would like to have in Anaplan before starting on building Anaplan; this will make the build easier, faster and ultimately result in a better model output. If you try to design a process during the build, it can quickly get messy as things are built/rebuilt or the direction is changed halfway through the build."

In each implementation the result was that analysts and managers spent less time inputting the data and could spend more time reviewing and fine tuning their departments. Anaplan has allowed for more collaborative planning across each organization",

I have modeled many things in Anaplan, from supply chains to call centres, to investment funds and also the obvious things like P&L's, Balance Sheet, and cashflow. You build everything from scratch so you can model pretty much anything\nAnother great use of Anaplan is where you want to guide the user to follow a process. You can add in whatever data validations/controls, process gates, signoff/approval stages you need. And provide the user with real-time analysis of how their inputs have impacted their plan and any KPI's connected to it\nThe best attribute that helps Anaplan's long term success with clients is how the models can be adapted to move with the business, so as the business and its environment changes, the model can adapt and stay relevent. Which stops users reverting back to Excel\nThe focus of new features over the past few years has been very much on making the end users experience better. So model builders have been left behind somewhat, mainly from the point of view of writing and interrogating formulas, so there is scope to make our lives easier and modelling even faster. However there is an update expected soon which is promised to make the modelers lives a lot easier, so watch this space\nIntegrated P&L > Balance Sheet > Cashflow\nThis significantly sped up the quarterly forecasting process for my client, and I also built lots of checks for account mappings to identify any holes in the mappings which could cause a variance to the balance sheet or any of the inbuild balance checks. As the model was vast so the model admins had to really stay on top of new accounts or mappings coming in\n\nIFRS Modelling Contract Revenue\nAnaplan was able to perform the calcs at a much more detailed level than excel, which was already at its limits and provides lots of analysis for the business. Although the primary purpose was for statutory reporting on the clients' contracts over the contract life\n\nPrivate Equity Fund modeling\nLooking backward at investor level to calculate provisions, and looking forward for the rest of the fund's life at a deal level. To determine the expected returns on investment. The main benefit for the client is providing a solid platform to bring together their actuals plus the ability to overlay what-ifs for the outlook and compare multiple scenarios against each other. The inputs being at a level high enough for fund managers to relate to, but the underlying logic is very detailed to the extent of making decisions on when to call from or distribute to investors in a more life like way\n\nSupply vs Demand modelling\nIn a range of industries, including energy, telecoms, and consumer goods. The principle is fairly similar for all of these industries, matching supply and demand, identifying variances. As with previous applictaions the main benefits were related to performing the calculations at a more detailed level than Excel can handle, and providing operations with multiple scenarios to try out mutiple ways to resolve supply or demand issues Anaplan picks up from where"

        "answers_raw": "Anaplan is a cloud-based application that can connect multiple cells and workspaces across different business use-cases and give a concise view of the KPIs.\nReal-time security is enabled with instant changing of roles, and access is possible in Anaplan. Excel cannot restrict individual cell access. Anaplan has the flexibility to plan across many dimensions, which excel does not have.\nThe PowerPoint add-in feature is a little obsolete and unnecessary with the launch of the new UX.\nAnaplan helps with different types of planning. I have been involved in Financial Planning and Analysis for four years now. I am assisting clients in moving from Excel sheets to Anaplan planning UX. Anaplan can have scheduled data integrations from external data sources such as Informatica Cloud, SnapLogic, Mulesoft, Dell Boomi, Docusign, Workiva, and Tableau. It has dynamic time scale implementation.\nMaster Data structure \u2013 works on having one data hub with a single source of truth, build once and push multiple times approach.Pushing hierarchical changes across multiple worksheets is tough and error-prone \nEasy for business users to adapt and easy to maintain. Anaplan has checks and balances in place to flag errors and correct inputs."

            "<v ->My name is Ricardo T., I'm a Senior Financial Analyst</v> in the mobile security software industry, and I gave Anaplan a 7 out of 10. Anaplan is a cloud based tool which allows the team to work simultaneously in the same model without having to worry about any version control issues. Once the model is set up, the formulas are very (mouth claps) steady and there's no real need to really worrying about formulas breaking so the model is very steady once it is fully set up and operational. One of my least favorite features about Anaplan is having to learn the MDX coding in order to update the model and formulas. So, this is a coding language that is unique to most financial tools. Oftentimes it requires a consultant, and again it is (mouth claps) unique to financial tools, so, it is an investment in yourself and learning Anaplan. Anaplan is a planning tool which most makes sense for companies that are already a little bit more sure on their growth path. You either have a dedicated or almost dedicated person who can learn the MDX coding and who can maintain and update the model, that's one alternative."

            "The best part about using Anaplan is the ease of connecting models & various use cases into a consolidated format for the end users. For example, a P&L can be the backbone of a reporting model with smaller calculation models that feed the end result. This allows the models to be more granular in nature without affecting the main submission model and reduces performance impacts on the main model.",
            "Some functions are limited (like subset of versions, subsets of users), but there are workarounds that the community has suggested. The roadmap is constantly developing and we are seeing some issues addressed with the releases. One major aspect that is recently being addressed is the key word highlighting when writing formulas. It is still in its infancy and has a bit of ways to go before it can be fully utilized.",
            "Our use cases currently include aggregating a bottoms-up forecast for financial metrics, allocations of sales data for more granular visibility into performance, a bottoms-up calculation to determine COGM by product and region. It ultimately shortens time to understand where the numbers are coming from; perform allocations with minimal interaction; integrates with 3rd party platforms via APIs. We have seen a reduction in errors per forecast and time required in the model.",
            "Spend the time upfront to flesh out your data structures & feeds - it can save you many headaches once you're knee-deep building a model. Keep a close relationship with the ones building integrations and tables in your warehouse if you don't have a resource dedicated to your team. Otherwise, it can be cumbersome to develop the proper connections for your data automation processes."

The flexibility in Anaplan is at times a detriment as there are many different paths to arrive at the end goal, and many paths will cause performance problems or are inefficient.

The benefits we've had specifically to the SPM models surround the notion of having real time updates in a centralized system rather than sending out 50 Excel files, getting 50 Excel files in return and manually consolidating into a single report.  The amount of time that is saved on the consolidating alone is probably a half day of effort per week.  Other benefits specific to revenue planning is our revenue planning models in Excel were complex, large and very slow.  We often had data quality issues with Excel, at times saving the Excel file would take several minutes.  With Anaplan, those Excel specific performance issues were eliminated, it was easy to build out new dashboards and different views of the same data for BI. Anaplan SPM"

These quirks in the model can be sometimes hard to explain to an end-user who is used to Excel or Google Sheets, and does not understand the nature of the hyperblock or the way that Anaplan's software will approach a formula to try to calculate that.

            "<v ->Hello, my name is Paul O'Malley</v> and I am the GM of Commercial Accounting for Blue Cross. Blue Cross is a residential age care provider in Victoria, in Australia. We also have a number of home-care clients across a number of services, CHSP, VHC, DVA, private and home care packages. And I would rate Board eight out of 10. Board was initially brought into Blue Cross to solve a number of questions. One, about having one source of truth for our data. The other was around sharing financial data with our residents' managers more quickly and effectively. And also, having a further, deeper dive into our labor costs. Labor costs are about 65 to 75% of the revenue of the business. And so, Board was the tool that was going to unlock a deeper dive analysis into that cost every month. Good thing about Board is it links complex data sets from a number of systems. Once you have data and you have a mapping to overlay on top of the data, you can link it. We have multiple payroll systems for TNA, Rightech and Inova, and we pull all that data into our financial system, AIM, and we were able to link it to unlock a number of reporting that's very, very useful to us. Sick leave reporting, annual leave, long service leave, hours reporting to compare actual versus budget. The screens that you build in Board are also very, the length to allow dashboard creation, very easy and simple. They're simple to use. And it's also a very good tool to compare information effectively. I wouldn't say I'm overly negative about Board, but there are some things that we have found difficult, such as data that just disappears. Now, I need to probably quantify that in that we have had very, very successful dealings with Board and our partner Light Arch to fix all of our problems very quickly. So the data disappearing is probably the biggest one. There was also, historically, we had built a lot of old reports that our business wanted to just maintain that as we rolled forward, and so, rebuilding those old reports in Board was quite difficult, rather than, which I think the simple thing would be to just reboot everything and just build it as the system supports, which we didn't do. There's a couple of important things that you need to be very clear on. You will need someone in your team that knows your data very, very well. A data scientist or someone with very strong systems and data understanding. Once you have that person in place, you probably need to build out a data dictionary for every report or every piece of information that you need to bring from the systems into Board. That's the key, having that set up at the very start, knowing what your, if something does go wrong in the implementation phase, you always have that data dictionary to go back to, to compare, what did we start out this process to achieve, and have that set at the start. And I think patience. We've rolled Board out to over 70 members of our organization, and it takes time. You need to maintain the system well, maintain people's expectations of the system well. When, say for example, if Board doesn't update overnight, there needs to be a test at the start in the morning to make sure that you know that in advance so that the users don't get frustrated that our Board didn't update last night. So it's kind of having a good framework for how you're going to manage the rollout and implementation of the system and how you are going to administrate the system once it's out there and you've got a number of users on the platform. And then, have fun. It's a great system. It hasn't got many limitations. And really, it's a very fun process going from data to implementation and then to actually using the system."

Also, although their professional services team was fantastic during and post-implementation, I haven't had as much luck with the traditional support path of creating a ticket with their support team. The few times I tried, the tickets took a long time to be addressed, and the answers weren't very helpful, which shows a knowledge transfer gap between the professional services team and the support team as to system specifics that are unique to a given customer's environment. Also, it is tough to make changes in the system without a Board consultant or having someone highly skilled in Board's complex design by cube. Although we implemented their Budgeting and Forecasting module, it quickly became useless as we made changes in our business that we couldn't easily adjust for within the system.

However, with the support from the team from BOARD, we were able to plan our key milestones properly in a \"phase\" approach. Once you get the hang of the tool, you will be off to use the tool without any external assistance! \r\n\r\nNot only did we use it as a BI tool, it also helps us with the corporate performance management. When the timesheet is updated by staff, it is now immediately viewable through the reports that we can generate on the fly. This actually helps out a lot for our HR department.\r\n\r\nLastly, as a product which is out in the market for a while, the community from public forums  is large enough to handle simple questions. Simple googling solves our technical problems in minutes.",

            "We first started using Board during a period of time toward the end of our pipeline  where we were focusing on what had worked and didn't work during this particular project. After a session of team lead post mortem, we were able to dedicate resources to looking at new software, techniques and work flows going forward into the next project.\r\n\r\nOne of these was Board, and even in these stages of reflection, what surprised the team in general was how much Board was already helping in our search for research and development, even at this stage.\r\n\r\nFor situations where a logical and correct decision was to made, or even just planning a clear path toward a first goal or objective, the fluidity of Board and it's easy to understand nature, brought everyone together in solidarity of one clear aim.",
            "the overall problem that we found was being able to roll this out from a small team scenario into wider parts of the company or other teams. I feel if everyone had been on board from the start (excuse the pun), we would have been able have a clear and correct way of working.\r\n\r\nRolling Board out in stages required continued explanation, and a much bigger effort of transition than would have been ideal. That said, this could have been short sightedness internally having come at this apporach from a brainstorm and research and development phase of the project.\r\n\r\nGoing forward I would recommend having Board integrated into your workflow from the start",
            "Analysis is absolutely key, and the ease and intuitive nature of Board just made things so much clearer with regard to setting goals and the path to each one. we were able to easily discuss and implement solutions to each ares of our planning stage knowing that the process would become automated in it's own right as we continued through with out pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe interactive dashboard alone was a real eye opener in being able to share ideas and opinions. Everyone was up to date and on the same page with every piece of relevant information you could want, laid out in a clear and concise manner.",
            "If you, or a team you are working with deals with any form of marketing, Sales or HR, then you will absolutely need a system like this in place, and you could do alot worse than Board. I feel as the company grows, and there are more and more users working centrally from one system of analytics, the presence of Board and of it's service will only get stronger and more refined.\r\n\r\nTest it with key members of the team already dealing in the roles mentioned above, get everyone on board from the start, and they will all be able to be well informed, and make decisions with concise clarity."

BOARD supports imports from various different platforms and it is compatible with databases such as MySQL. It's extremely handy and saves us from manually importing massive amounts of data. You can effectively run queries on this data without even knowing how to code. The automation of BOARD saves countless time and makes life a lot easier for us.\r\n\r\nOther features we regularly make use of is automatic report building based on the data entry and produced graphs/tables. This saves us from manually writing up reports based on data that has been collected, the automated software will interpret the data and automatically create a report for you. \r\n\r\nIt's definitely THE single software for any business to have.

            "It is very easy to get into and so it allows a great self service BI. Users can just jump in. Most of it is self explaining. That's quite the exception when it comes to BI tools.\r\nMore complexity is still possible and allows for a differentiation of reports. This is always important as people will, in time, want to have some standard reports that provide more/better displayed data than what can be achieved with basic knowledge. And here is where the great community comes in; support on the board pages by board users is excellent.\r\nIt is also very easy to set up data input. This could solve many cases where otherwise Excel reports are sent accross the organisation just to fill in data with the difficulty that the format needs to be maintained.",
            "It seems that many of the newer features are developed as islands. Sometimes they lack integration with the rest of the system. What comes to mind is the for computations of data there are \"column algorithm\", \"nexel formulas\", \"rules\", \"analytical functions\" just for the data display. One needs to be knowledgeable when to use what and they have sometimes unexpected interactions.",
            "At this stage we mostly review sales data. Board allows for much easier drill down functionality than what would be possible with Excel based reports. In comparison to bigger suites such as from IBM Cognos or Microsoft (SSAS, SSRS, SSIS) development is much quicker to get first results to the screen and the decision makers.",
            "Ensure you know the needs of the users. Do you have many users that would like to get off Excel? Is there a need to standardise current Excel reports? Then Board is a perfect choice keeping costs and necessary knowledge low.\r\nIf you expect your users to analyse data themselves and adapt existing reports to current needs then also Board is a very good choice.\r\nBoard would be the wrong choice when it comes to pixel perfect reports. If your users don't need to modify the report layout or quickly drill down into deeper levels, then maybe Board is not necessary."

            "There are still some aspects of Board which need work, most are actually fairly small things such as GUI improvements which would simply give a better user experience (most noticeably at the back end for the developer). Many of the limitations such as chart customisation features have been addressed in the most recent releases.",
            "As with most companies increasing data visibility and encouraging proper analysis are our primary goals, historically BI has often been treated as little more than an extension of source system reporting in our company, however using Board has enabled us to really hammer home to our users just how valuable proper analysis can be, and how much easier it can make their jobs at time. We've also finally managed to get a consolidated global picture of our client base without the need for a lot of manual number crunching and enormous Excel spreadsheets, something which is already paying huge dividends in terms of understanding how our client base varies by global region and the potential opportunities that offers for leveraging existing relationships.",
            "If you have large datasets and you're looking for a tool which will allow you to surface that data in meaningful and easy to use ways, you could do a lot worse. I've found Board to be quicker than most other tools both for loading large datasets and for subsequently reporting on them."

Besides that, it is very easy to ramp up your learning on the platform, implementation can be completed in under a week, and they have an excellent source of consultants and internal success managers that will make sure that you succeed in your journey. We started with a Financial data model but have also moved our revenue forecasting into its own cube that can easily communicate with the other to pull in Budget, Actual, and Reforecast data seamlessly. If anyone is on the fence about taking the leap, feel free to find me on LinkedIn and I will run you through my experience.",

We have also integrated our revenue forecast data into Vena, and we plan on actually exporting a portion out into R, run it through a model and then sync it back into Vena for our more variable usage components to get closer to a 99% CI. Within the next year we also plan to integrate our HRS into Vena so that we can establish a place for our HCM to be done in a more seamless fashion."

You do not need to know coding to write lengthy codes like sql to extract the data. It can easily be done by mapping level of members you need the data for. Absolutely love the attributes feature, very useful to organize the data. Love that we can integrate with other software,  easy to import data export data\nI wish there were more flexibility to bring data while using the expressions in dynamic mappings, like being able to get all bottom level members of the parent and attribute intersection.\nOften the time to load a template or report is longer than expected. For a bigger report, it takes about 20 minutes to load the report. It would be great if we can somehow get that faster. \nWhile working in the modeler tab, creating new members or updating members, multiple updates cannot be made. We have to wait for one update to be made before trying for another and sometimes we get error. It is time consuming to make multiple updates in the Hierarchy.\nIt is worth a try. Please reach out to the vena team and see how the team can help make your day to day work easier\nI help with creating new reports for all levels of users. FP&A staff, VP of Finane and Executives require different details and I love the ability for users to select the level of details they need.\nI add users and their permissions, as we have many regions we work with and it is easy to maintain everything using vena.\nIntegration between the different platforms we use is very helpful as well"

Vena makes our forecasting more accurate and more accessible to track the associate costs.\nSometimes it's slow because of the size of the model. Or when you missed an update and have to go back to fix it all.  The cell calculations don't stay, so it's hard to go back and see what you did or why you did it.\nSometimes if I'm working with another coworker on a client, it is hard to track their changes.  Sometimes I spend a lot of time trying to figure that out to adjust it back to the correct amount.\nIt's great for large teams that are working on the same model.  It's excellent for exporting data and presentations for clients.\nI use it for budgeting and forecasting.  It's much easier with how our team built it out.  We are all able to make the same updates at the same time.

At the same time, casual users can easily enter data, run reports, create ad hoc queries, and drill to details.  Vena has replaced all of the high maintenance Excel workbooks used to create budgets and generate financial statements in the past.  It allows us to quickly consolidate a complex organization with more than 100 entities and easily report on any level, from a full division to a single location.",
            "The user security features do their job but are probably the least intuitive part of the system.",
            "Gathering input from dozens of contributors was a challenge with standard Excel workbooks.  Users might change formulas, move rows or columns, and generally wreak havoc, then expect Finance to put all the pieces back together.  Consolidating the budget or forecast was difficult with fertile ground for errors.  Because Vena stores everything to a central database with always connected and protected templates, a rolled up view is available on demand and without grief.  The cherry on top is an audit trail that can tell you exactly who changed what numbers and when.\n\nBecause Vena was already in place and has the ability to easily store inputs from multiple users, we were able to solve non-financial problems thrown at us by the COVID crisis.  In less than a day, we created a new data cube and templates to track PPE inventory (masks, gloves, gowns, etc.)  at all locations throughout the state.  Users enter their daily inventory allowing purchasing and operations to quickly see the status and move supplies where they are most needed.  Additionally, we are able to capture and compile COVID related costs for required reporting on government stimulus funds.",

Take the time to think through the things you want to achieve and design your data cube(s) with future flexibility in mind.  Find the right person in your organization to champion the product and give them time to focus on implementing it well."

            "Vena is Excel-based, which is helpful for just about anyone in FP&A. The level of complexity  in the instance really depends on the goals & skill set of the FP&A team in question, and the investment in time a group is willing to train on the software.  The complexity can come from writing calc scripts in Vena, creating links to external data sources, or just utilizing Excel formulas.  \n\nIt's also very flexible; one can write static reports that can be manually changed as needed if standard formats are required, or more dynamic reports that can automatically detect changes in account mapping, which is a big time saver for a businesses that needs to add revenue or expense accounts.\n\nVena has obviously been working on automating connections with external data sources like Salesforce, which expands its usefulness.  After the initial setup, this can be a big time saver, but the setup can take considerable time.\n\nThe sense of community has been good for us, as we joined a local area meetup to get ideas on what other FP&A teams were using the software for and found we could be using it better on our own team.  We also attended the annual user conference which was fun and very educational.\n\nThe support staff is always helpful & responsive, and the account manager & coach we've worked with have been helpful.",
            "There are few downsides, but here are a couple:\n\n- for me, the \"year: attribute\" function can be tricky - when straddling fiscal years in terms of loading data (say you're closing FY20 but have FY21 open at the same time), I've been burned loading data to the incorrect fiscal year, and have had to go back and zero out an entire period's worth of data, re-load, change the year attribute to be correct, and then load the data correctly.  This is user error, of course, but I wish Vena had a way to grab the date of transaction and automatically flag the load or provide some type of warning, or at least provide an \"undo\" feature to go back to the prior dataset. \n\n- there are several different ways to do things, which is actually a huge positive, but it also can cause some issues when researching in the knowledge base.  Some of the solutions seem like they could be handled in a simpler fashion but require the use of calc scripts, etc.",
            null,
            "Our business is highly transactional, which means we have lots of data and need to look at it in various ways from an operational standpoint.  We are just now getting to a point of using statistical accounts to load prior year data and current data so we can start to trend operational metrics.  We are also loading bookings data from salesforce using a data connector which will be very useful.  Beyond that, the use of multi-dynamic mapping should simplify our tying-out process after loading final values each month/quarter/year between Vena and our in-house accounting system.\n\nAll of this has and will continue to save time for our small FP&A team.  Eventually, we'd like to get to a place where our business partners/VPs can use Vena as well to further streamline our budgeting process."

            "Vena is a powerful tool for developing and sharing forecasts and budgets. This application has allowed me to create powerful agile input templates for the end users to enter their forecast or budget projections. Vena makes the consolidation of this data easy: the consolidated data is displayed in reports and is easily refreshed with the push of a button.\n\nThe fact that Vena relies on Excel makes the learning curve less steep for some users. The entire setup process can be done internally as opposed to relying on second party consultants. Reports and input forms are built in Excel and while there is some learning required to master the mapping and data querying processes, it is fairly easy to comprehend.\n\nSetting up and maintaining data cubes is intuitive and quick. Data hierarchies and dimensions can be either set up through the web interface (drag and drop type), mass upload via CSV file, or a combination of both techniques.",
            "Vena relies heavily on Excel and therefore a robust knowledge of this tool is required to fully leverage the application's capabilities. Mistakes can easily be made if some users are unclear as to how the mapping process works. I wish there would be more control features in place to limit the type of input that some group of users can make.\n\nThe permissions setup process is a little too complex, with different overlapping layers of permissions. Setting up users can be challenging at first.\n\nThe mapping process in Excel can be time consuming for large report files. Each intersection cell needs to be mapped and although several cells can be mapped simultaneously, the process is still slower than querying data via Excel formula (as some applications allow). Mapping cells is done solely through a pop-up window in Excel and mapping cannot be copied through the standard Excel copy-paste feature. Also, mapping can become extremely slow on larger files (40+ sheets), with the Vena pop-up window taking as long as one minute to appear in these cases.",
            "Vena helps us tackle the challenge of consolidating data from different user groups. We no longer have to maintain different copies on local computers or shared drives. Instead, we can all work on the same files simultaneously and the data entered is automatically consolidated in the Vena cloud database. Consolidation of user input was a challenge across an organization of our size. With Vena, we can simply hit the refresh button, and all data populates the fields which are mapped.",

            "Vena has been such a positive in our world! After an exhaustive search, we decided that Vena was the system for ACME for financial reporting needs.\n\nWithin the first week of using the system we had 3 years of information loaded, consolidations performed and financial statements written.  \n\nThe initial training was fantastic (we were lucky enough to get a good partner who gave me one-on-one training) so I was in control of the education. I realize that not everyone can get this kind of customized training, but it was worth it. I \"drove\" the process and the consultant corrected and helped me along during the process.\n\nAfter we were on our own, we extended the processes to include budgeting and forecasting which has made analysis so quick and useful during changing times.\n\nWe are working with our ERP to get auto-transmission of data into the system but until we are able to get that working, we can mimic this process by manually loading the transactions from our system(s) so month end analysis on the detailed transactions are available on a consolidated basis. This has proved beneficial to parce out actual detail and give the responsible parties for analysis. Once we finally have an auto feed it will be a seamless process to any end user (only quicker).\n\nBecause Vena is more than a financial reporting software we are currently starting to use it for other database information. Tracking our PPE inventory, looking at metrics and historical information. Currently, we're running this information in excel and it's so much that it's bogging down our spreadsheets. Having refresh-able information at our fingertips is easing the stress.",
            "Very little to dislike! I would like to see expanded training on the training website for more than the basics. (Calc's, setting up process flows, etc.) Since they've been adding new things quite often, i'm sure it's in the queue to be done.",
            "Consolidation of information. 1 place to look at the data instead of multiple systems (we have multiple ERP's here.) Achieving quality financial statements quickly has been our #1 benefit.",

And the reason why I dislike that at the same time as liking it, is I know that some people aren't exactly Excel savvy. So if you don't like Excel it might not be the best tool. What we solve a ton of business problems with Vena. We use Vena to amalgamate all of our practice management data, or billing software data. All of our general ledger data. We use Vena to automate the production of financial statements at the end of every month. We use Vena, and one of the biggest things I use it for is it automates the transformation of all of our data, out of our. Well both the general ledger and the practice management system, in that it completely maps, you know if we have one field. And in the past we would've had to manually map that field to different mappings and properties. Vena does that completely automatically. It does it over night if we choose to run the job then. There's a few other Items those are the biggest three that I love Vena for.

            "I dislike Adaptive's/Workday's business model because it incentives customer neglect.  During our evaluation process Adaptive seemed to have an excellent product and it was reasonably priced.  During this process we explained to the sales person that we had a very tight implementation goal and he reassured us several times that it would be challenging but we could make it.  The problem is that as soon as the licensing agreement was signed they passed us off to an implementation consultant (Revelwood), and it was up to Revelwood to deliver on all the promises Adaptive made.\r\n\r\nRevelwood confirmed that the timeline was going to be tight but said they could do it.  We agreed to a very minimal feature implementation in order to achieve the go live.  However, Revelwood repeatedly missed deadlines, had extremely poor communication, and did a terrible job of project management.   \r\n\r\nAfer missing a couple deadlines I complained to Adaptive and they raised the issue with Revelwood who responded by changing project managers.  The new project manager seemed like he was going to be great and I was hopeful everything would get back on track.  However, first impressions were misleading and we had all the same issues.  At one point our goal was to go live by Thanksgiving (our original go live was mid-June) and I told them that if there was any reason we would not be able to hit that goal I wanted to be notified as far in advance as possible and not to find out a day or two before we failed to go live.  Instead of giving me advance warning that we would miss the deadline, or even last minute notice, they simply told me nothing.  Thanksgiving came and went and they were completely silent.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it got so late in the year we had to put the project on hold so we could do our annual budgeting process, still in Excel instead of Adaptive as we had expected.  Revelwood's repeated excuse was that our timeline for implementation was too aggressive.  However, by the time we put the project on hold it was past the duration they said was typical for a full implementation and we were doing an extremely minimal implementation.  So their excuse doesn't hold water.\r\n\r\nIt has been over a year since we signed the original subscription agreement and we still do not have a functional system.  Since we have not been using the system a client success manager from Adaptive reached out to us to see what they could do.  Unfortunately, do to competing priorities we will not be able to restart the implementation for several months.  This means we will have paid for 2 years of service and gotten absolutely no value out of it.  As such, I asked Adaptive if they could credit us for our first year of service and put a pause on our next invoice due shortly.  They said they couldn't do that.\r\n\r\nThis brings us back to their horrible business model (which I think is pretty common for large software packages like this).  During the sales process Adaptive is willing to promise the moon because they know they won't have to deliver on any of those promises.  They will pass the customer off to someone else and yet Adaptive still gets 3 years of subscription fees regardless of customer experience.  And Adaptive does not care enough about the long term relationship with the customer to be concerned about whether they are having a good experience.  They just want their 3 years of revenue.  This seems very short sighted on their part.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of good FP&A systems out there and I regret choosing Adaptive.  We are currently considering going with a different FP&A system even though it means we will have a third year of wasted subscription fees.  Finding a true business partner may be worth the expense - that is how disappointing this experience has been.",

This proves extremely frustrating as the real-time visibility and budgeting abilities are lost.\r\n\r\nThe integration support within Adaptive can also be made more comprehensive.

The double whammy on both WD and AI side results in a lot of manual intervention when we are looking to bring in distinct values.

Additionally, Office Connect has an abysmal time integrating with Excel, and often slows down or crashes the program entirely.

            "The flexibility offered by this product is amazing, it allows you to build a model that suits your business needs. Regardless of HOW you do business, Adaptive supports this as you create your own structure, custom accounts, and cost drivers, and  then consolidate the data to reports and dashboards,\r\n\r\nImplementing Adaptive for our budgeting was a game changer, it put the data in the hands of the budget owners. As budgets changed throughout the iterative process, we knew that we were always looking at the most up-to-date version by running a single report - no more manual reconciliations / updates. ",
            "Because the software is so flexible, you have to be very careful when creating formulas and building reports that you are capturing all of the information. While it is easy to segment a particular set of data, it is also easy to leave that out if you do not understand the structure and connections within the various moving pieces. Take the time to plan your organization and account structure, and really take the time to understand it, and you will be fine. ",
            "We have gained major efficiencies in our annual budget process - cutting down time spent consolidating budgets or getting the data in to the right format for different stakeholders. This allows our Finance team to spend more time on analysis and strategy than data entry. In addition, with the ability to have different versions, we have moved to a more frequent forecasting schedule, which allows us to keep a better eye on how we are tracking and manage risk.  Fantastic Product And Vendor Support, But Invest The Time",
            "If you can, meet some customers in your industry who use Adaptive already. Now, we are in contact with another organization who went live before we did, and we have helped each other to build tools and reports and address challenges that apply to both companies. It would have been great to learn about some of the challenges up front and how we could have addressed some of the shortcomings of our other software, or with a change to our configuration before implementing. And again, take the time to first review your financial planning and reporting processes and figure out how you can improve them using the new system, rather than trying to fit Adaptive to your \"current state\"."

For example, to change an accounts forecast, I have to go to COS, make edits, save, go to Revenue, make edits save, and then check the final output to see if what I did had the desired effect.  You can mitigate this somewhat with linking but I'd like to see faster loading between these sheets or easier navigation between sublevels of the same level.  Maybe a side-by-side option where you can see what changes to rollup will occur with changes to a level.",

            "We began to look at planning and reporting software because we needed a system that could handle extensive cost allocations, multiple budget versions, varied organizational structures and provide us with TIMELY and powerful reporting, drill down and analysis. Adaptive has delivered on all fronts.",
            "My recommendation to others looking at Adaptive is to ask questions, dream big and be prepared to view the budget planning and reporting process differently. Adaptive is a whole new ballgame-don't limit yourself before you even get off the bench.\r\n\r\nI would also strongly recommend that you purchase the complete Adaptive Suite and not just planning. It make a lot of difference to the overall usefulness as they complement each other. "
