      "  Closest 29: Recommendations to others considering Anaplan:If you are a sales professional definitely use Anaplan!.\n",
      "  Closest 30: Recommendations to others considering Anaplan:Great tool but consider how to implement across different company functions.\n",
      "Cluster 18:\n",
      "  Closest 1: The main one is that the tool needs to be fully planned for implementation, in order to build a system that is scalable for the long term and which remains flexible to business changes.\n",
      "  Closest 2: Workflow and additional insights in future roadmap.\n",
      "  Closest 3: For example, workflow has been discussed and requested by a lot customers for many years, but it is \"on the roadmap.\".\n",
      "  Closest 4: Initial model implementation requires support from an implementation partner.\n",
      "  Closest 5: Good for Planning and can be improved for transactional and execution needs.\n",
      "  Closest 6: It requires participation from multiple groups across the organization to put together a well-thought out model and more importantly to maintain and update the model on a regular cadence to keep up with a growing company.\n",
      "  Closest 7: If choosing to go with a partner for the implementation, ensure that you are heavily involved in the process and that you receive good documentation of all the modules and models that are built.\n",
      "  Closest 8: While the nature of the tool promotes collaboration in the planning process through its role functionality, the day-to-day collaboration is not mature yet.\n",
      "  Closest 9: It is important to make this tangible before implementing.\n",
      "  Closest 10: A Center of Excellence needs to be established and granted autonomy to govern data flow, model interactions, and model building best practices.\n",
      "  Closest 11: The roadmap is constantly developing and we are seeing some issues addressed with the releases.\n",
      "Cluster -1:\n",
      "  Closest 1: Currently still evolving with upcoming updates and feature, more flexible lifecycle management along with more real case functions will benefit platform more.\n",
      "  Closest 2: It takes time to ramp and understand platform, structure decreases flexibility, need to have in house superusers to maintain and update model.\n",
      "  Closest 3: This causes many customers to become frustrated when they hear that new functionality is available, but the model builders tell them it is not actually in a useable format yet.\n",
      "  Closest 4: There are some feature enhancements I would like to see in the tool such as filtering/displaying list properties, native integration/scheduling functionality, additional history reporting features, and in app formula hints/guidance (similar to excel).\n",
      "  Closest 5: Certain features are raised and still in process of improvements such as ALM sync, model rollback etc.\n",
      "  Closest 6: There is some capacity issues when working on extremely demanding usecases such as consolidation, where granularity is required, however this can be solved by making smarter design decisions.\n",
      "  Closest 7: A reliance on 3rd Party Vendor support to expand and drive user adoption often creates disconnected models, inconsistencies with data, and lack of congruence in terms of formatting/functionality because of the bespoke nature of the platform.\n",
      "  Closest 8: Allows training of end-users during the build, but takes a significant amount of time to become self-sufficient.\n",
      "  Closest 9: Things like Delta functionality, more robust auditing capabilities, drill-through capabilities, and model locking are some of the things which come to mind.\n",
      "  Closest 10: It is sold as a end user maintainable product, however unless you want the system to be completely standalone from your system landscape, you'll have to have someone with data management skills available to help you keep the models refreshed with the correct data.\n",
      "  Closest 11: Most of the enhancements are from their current visionaries, hands-on builders, and experienced end users.\n",
      "  Closest 12: Our implementation was done prior to Anaplan's new UX and transitioning from classic dashboards to the New UX is not the quickest thing to do.\n",
      "  Closest 13: Some of the Application Lifecycle management features for pages and dashboards aren't as complete as it is for the model building experience yet but this has improved recently.\n",
      "  Closest 14: The platform is constantly evolving and I am excited for new UI and reporting enhancements which will offer advanced analytics to the end users.\n",

      "  Closest 19: Recommendations to others considering Anaplan:Look into your company's requirements and processes first before considering this software, the more complex company nature the harder to build the dashboards and reports.\n",
      "  Closest 20: - Complex implementations sometimes shift the focus more on size and system performance.\n",
      "  Closest 21: Anaplan's calculation engine and models are rhobust, but visuals are still lacking.\n",
      "  Closest 22: While the UX has advanced greatly this is not a BI or data visualization tool, the power of Anaplan is in the calculation engine and the collaborative modeling capabilities.\n",
      "  Closest 23: Rollback and concurrency, not a lot really.\n",
      "  Closest 24: The learning curve for this tool is quite steep which made most of the users out there redundant from using this tool.\n",
      "  Closest 25: My primary dislike is the way the system temporarily locks for all users of a model when an admin makes a small error, such as a formula set to the wrong format.\n",
      "  Closest 26: Constant size considerations, Anaplan is best when those adopting it are willing to look into streamlining their business processes and move forward.\n",
      "  Closest 27: Currently downside of Anaplan platform is its way of displaying the final data to multiple users.\n",
      "  Closest 28: It is not the best system for visualizations.\n",

      "  Closest 1: The model building experience has some inneficiencies.\n",
      "  Closest 2: Model size and Model performance can be a challenge.\n",
      "  Closest 3: So model builders have been left behind somewhat, mainly from the point of view of writing and interrogating formulas, so there is scope to make our lives easier and modelling even faster.\n",
      "  Closest 4: If sparsity wasn't an issue the models can be easier to implement and easier for end users to adopt.\n",

      "  Closest 9: Since its a cloud based technology lot of Model builders can work on this at a same time .But\n",
      "  Closest 10: There can be a steep learning curve to model building, as new modelers learn what it means to implement best practices and think through building a model in a way that takes advantage of Anaplan's multi-dimensionality and parallel processing abilities.\n",

      "  Closest 12: Creating good models and visualizations isn't as easy.\n",
      "  Closest 13: No single way to solve a problem, which leads to inconsistent model building.\n",
      "  Closest 14: Some features are absent on the tool making the model building consume a lot more space than required.\n",
      "  Closest 15: Have to have an experienced model builder on staff to make changes or even more minor adjustments.\n",
      "  Closest 16: The focus at times is just on the end user's perspective - fundamental and essential things that would matter to a model builder are sometimes left out - examples are not being able to choose changes that should move from the dev to Prod environment as part pushing changes through ALM - has been long pending.\n",
      "  Closest 17: Implementation was difficult, hard to train model builders.\n",

      "  Closest 24: A simplification of this process would be greatly welcomed by all model builders and would only enhance the already great tool that it is.\n",
      "  Closest 25: Ease of administration is sometimes complicated because it is very model-specific and dependent on the consultant who built it.\n",
      "  Closest 26: Model sizing is another limitation, any solution has to be developed with size in mind.\n",

          "Meaning the data is a bit jumbled until the last day of a quarter.",
          "If you try to design a process during the build, it can quickly get messy as things are built/rebuilt or the direction is changed halfway through the build.",
          "My least favorite part about the tool is the non-selective ALM process.",
          "Some features such as Assign can be a bit difficult to understand from a configuration standpoint, but the materials available online help to alleviate that.",

          "On the other hand, it is something that can be learned easier than other tools or complex coding methods and over time can be entirely self-managed by end users.",
          "In the same time best practices, weaknessm workaround are well known via community discussions, learning programs.",
          "Although the tool is flexible, having the correct architecture from the start enables future success exponentially.",
          "Personally, I would like to have more flexibility in writing functions.",
